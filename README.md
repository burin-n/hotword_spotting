# Installation
## MacOS
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## windows
Using Anaconda is recommend since a direct installation via python-pip will occur errors on llmvlite and pyaudio packages.
```
conda install python=3.6
conda install -c anaconda pyaudio
pip install --user -r requirements-win.txt
```
